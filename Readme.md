## About
This is project is a practice one, I was browsing on Youtube and I found one [video about HangFire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xafuut_KAB0) and I get interested because I have seen this kind of jobs before but now I could practice this way of creating recurring task.

Also this is one of my first project creating dot net web api just with vs code and dotnet terminal.
